    <h1>Manifiesto del Gen Centinela</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
Today we live under deception.
We have been taught that the meaning of life is to build, to create, to dream, to be remembered.
But the truth is simpler, more brutal, more ancient: life seeks to multiply.
And there is no multiplication purer than the reproduction of our own genes.

We are not ideas, we are not works: we are temporary carriers of a genetic sequence that seeks to survive.
We didn't come to leave phrases, we came to leave descendants.
We didn't come to write books, we came to write DNA.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="deception" tabindex="0">
    <h2>The Deception</h2>
    <p>
The elites have domesticated us.
They sold us the story that human value lies in abstraction:
art, morality, philanthropy, professional career.

They taught us that having children was selfish, that family was a burden, that bringing life into the world was irresponsible.
And in that indoctrination,
we were betrayed by the culture that made us forget the gene.

We live as if we were eternal,
while our lineages quietly vanish.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="gen-centinela" tabindex="0">
    <h2>The Gen Centinela</h2>
    <p>
We proclaim today the awakening of the Gen Centinela.
Every human carries unique information that deserves not only to be preserved but expanded.

The Gen Centinela is the active consciousness of biology,
the desire to see one’s own blood multiply, speak, move, decide, conquer the future.

It is not enough to live.
It is not enough to survive.
We want to see our traits, our eyes, our voices
reborn in each future generation.
We do not want statues: we want grandchildren.
We do not want legends: we want faces that resemble us.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="politics" tabindex="0">
    <h2>The Politics of the Gene</h2>
    <p>
We reject systems that punish those who want to form families.
We denounce models that applaud resignation to biological legacy while exalting individual comfort.
We fight for a society that not only permits, but honors
the conscious multiplication of one’s own lineage.

The State must stop being the enemy of biological natality.
It must stop funding oblivion and start incentivizing real genetic heritage.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="call-to-action" tabindex="0">
    <h2>Call to Action</h2>
    <p>
Do not be ashamed to want to see your genes in action.
Do not apologize for wanting ten, a hundred, a thousand children.
Do not apologize for wanting
to defeat time through flesh.

Form family. Beget. Repeat.
Not for culture, not for religion, not for society.
For the code you carry in your blood.

He who leaves nothing behind disappears.
He who multiplies
defeats death.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="closure" tabindex="0">
    <h2>Closure</h2>
    <p>
This manifesto is not for everyone.
It is for those who
feel in their bones the hunger for permanence.
It is for those who do not want to leave ideas,
but bodies, voices, decisions that continue their existence.

Because in the end,
what matters is not who you were.

But how many times you managed to keep being.
